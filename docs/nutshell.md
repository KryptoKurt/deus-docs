title: What is DEUS in a Nutshell?
description:

DEUS finance is a DeFi protocol and decentralised exchange that enables users to hold and trade blockchain derivatives of traditional assets on the Ethereum network. 
Assets can include cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, commodities and virtually any asset whose value a market can capture. 
DEUS Finance creates these assets through Registrars via DEUS Swap. Registrars are synthetic, virtual copies of assets or baskets of assets, pegged 1:1 to their real-world equivalents and spot price. 
Each Registrar is represented with its own ERC-20 token (wToken) and named with the underlying assets ticker or stock code, prefaced with a “w” as an example wTSLA would represent Tesla, Inc.(TSLA). 
The current market value or spot price of the assets are continuously provided to the system via oracles. The prices are delivered to the system live, during the assets real world trading hours.

 
Traders invest in Registrars (wTokens) through the DEUS Finance native platform DEUS Swap, our decentralised exchange. 
The funds are moved to the treasury, called Conductor Custody, and wTokens are minted in return.
Once a trader decides to sell their investment, they go to DEUS Swap during official stock trading hours where wTokens are burned by DEUS Swap and an amount equivalent to the current market value of the underlying asset(s) is paid from the treasury. 
If the wTokens are sold for a loss, the difference between their minted value and their burnt value will be paid “in" to the treasury. 
If the wTokens are sold for a profit the difference between their minted value and their burnt value will be paid "out" by the treasury. 
Tokens can still be moved around the Ethereum blockchain outside the regular trading hours, creating a 24/7 secondary market, and we are working on a solution to enable 24/7 trading through DEUS Swap. Users may also trade their wTokens through other exchanges, such as Uniswap, or even stake them.


Collateral for trading Registrars is derived from liquidity providers, who provide liquidity for the treasury. 
The treasury will receive the benefit of fees paid on all transactions of wTokens, profits from any loss made on trading Registrars and any capital gains of provided Liquidity. 
The reward structure also increases the amount of collateral held within the treasury enabling a higher volume of trading registrars to occur. 
Currently the ratio between collateral held and the volume of registrars traded is set at 350%, so for every $1MM in wTokens there is $3.5MM held as collateral by the liquidity providers.  A major part of DEUS Finance is incentivising the provision of liquidity through many mechanisms within the Deus Eco System.


To receive the rewards of being a liquidity provider, LPs can go to the Sands of Time Vaults and click the button to “Provide Liquidity" in each of the 5 Vaults. 
A step by step guide is provided HERE. 
A smart contract locks the collateral, and issues sTokens that can be placed in a balancer pool or traded on Balancer, thereby providing an exit from the vaults but keeping the collateral within the Deus Eco System.  
The tokens are locked for a set period of time in exchange for yields, the longer the tokens are locked, the higher the reward, the rewards are paid out in fees and are claimable at anytime.


DEUS Finance has solved the problem faced by other platforms, by keeping the Liquidity providers within the Deus Eco System, and seperate from traders of wTokens. 
Traders are effectively using our shopfront, being our decentralised exchange DEUS Swap. 
Liquidity providers are an integral part of the Deus eco system and are effectively acting as the bank, giving traders access to the stock market without requiring them to provide any collateral. 
High-risk investments will be separated from those with low risks, and there will be mechanisms in place preventing the creation of fraudulent or illegal Registrars.
